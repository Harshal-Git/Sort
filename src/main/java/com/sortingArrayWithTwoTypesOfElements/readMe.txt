There are different variations for this problem. All solutions are given.

1. Sort the given array as per +ve OR -ve elements. (Q1*.java)

	i/p: {13, -12, 18, -10}	=> o/p : {-12, -10, 13, 18} (array as a whole needs not to be sorted. we need separation of +ve & -ve)
	
2. Sort the given element in such a way that EVEN numbers will be on right side & ODD numbers will be on left. (Q2*.java)

	i/p: {15, 14, 13, 12} => o/p : {14, 12, 15, 13} (array as a whole needs not to be sorted.)
	
3. Sort a given binary array. (Q3*.java)

	i/p: {0, 1, 1, 1, 0} => o/p : {0, 0, 1, 1, 1}
