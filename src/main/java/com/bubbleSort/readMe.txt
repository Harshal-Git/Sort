Why name bubble ?

-> With a single iteration of the given array; the highest element from the array / remaining array will be bubbled up to right side.

-> To completely sort the array; array needs to be iterated for 'number of elements' times (every time from first position).

-> The naive algo can be improved further to reduce the number of comparisons done based on above fact#1.
